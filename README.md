# [Batman](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~lkreidberg/batman/index.html) 
a Python package for fast calculation of exoplanet transit light curves. 
The package supports calculation of light curves for any radially symmetric stellar limb darkening law, using a new integration algorithm for models that cannot be quickly 
calculated analytically.

## Installation
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install batman.

```bash
pip install batman-package
```
